# Retail_Time_series_forecasting
This repository contains a time series forecasting project using ARIMA, SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models. The project is part of my practice in time series analysis with the help of https://courses.analyticsvidhya.com/courses/take/creating-time-series-forecast-using-python/ , where I applied various techniques like rolling averages, stationarity tests, and seasonal decomposition to a real-world dataset.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to forecast future values based on historical data by leveraging the ARIMA, SARIMA models. SARIMA is an extension of the ARIMA model, which takes seasonality into account. This project walks through the following key steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and preparing data for analysis.
Stationarity Testing: Using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check the stationarity of the time series.
Differencing and Log Transformation: To stabilize variance and make the data more suitable for modeling.
Modeling with ARIMA, SARIMA: Building a model to capture both seasonal and non-seasonal patterns in the data.
